Entry points

:Entry: socket:

The socket() function shall create an unbound socket in a communications
domain, and return a file descriptor that can be used in later function calls
that operate on sockets.

Syntax:
dcl socket_dev$socket entry (fixed bin (35), fixed bin (35), fixed bin (35)) returns (fixed bin (35));
fd = socket (domain, type, protocol);

Arguments:

domain
   Specifies the communications domain in which a socket is to be created.
   (Input).
   AF_NET is the only supported value.

type
   Specifies the type of socket to be created. (Input)
   SOCK_STREAM is the only supported value. SOCK_STREAM+SOCK_NONBLOCK may be
   specified.

protocol
   Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Specifying a
   protocol of 0 causes socket() to use an unspecified default protocol
   appropriate for the requested socket type. (Input)
   IP is the only support value.

fd
   Upon successful completion, socket() shall return a non-negative integer,
   the socket file descriptor. Otherwise, a value of âˆ’1 shall be returned and
   errno set to indicate the error. (Output)
   XXX how do we handle errno?
