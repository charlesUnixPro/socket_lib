Entry points

:Entry: socket:

The socket() function shall create an unbound socket in a communications
domain, and return a file descriptor that can be used in later function calls
that operate on sockets.

Syntax:
dcl socket_dev$socket entry (fixed bin (35), fixed bin (35), fixed bin (35)) returns (fixed bin (35));
fd = socket (domain, type, protocol);

Arguments:

domain
   Specifies the communications domain in which a socket is to be created.
   (Input).
   AF_NET is the only supported value.

type
   Specifies the type of socket to be created. (Input)
   SOCK_STREAM is the only supported value. SOCK_STREAM+SOCK_NONBLOCK may be
   specified.

protocol
   Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Specifying a
   protocol of 0 causes socket() to use an unspecified default protocol
   appropriate for the requested socket type. (Input)
   IP is the only support value.

fd
   Upon successful completion, socket() shall return a non-negative integer,
   the socket file descriptor. Otherwise, a value of −1 shall be returned and
   errno set to indicate the error. (Output)
   XXX how do we handle errno?


:Entry: bind:

The bind() function shall assign a local socket address address to a socket
   identified by descriptor socket that has no local socket address assigned.
   Sockets created with the socket() function are initially unnamed; they are
   identified only by their address family.

Syntax: 
dcl socket_dev$bind entry (fixed bin (35), ptr, fixed uns bin (18)) returns (fixed bin (35));
code = bind (socket, address, address_len);


Arguments:

socket
   Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be bound. (Input).

address
   Points to a sockaddr structure containing the address to be bound to the
   socket. (Input)
   The length and format of the address depend on the address family of the
   socket. sockaddr_in is the only supported format and AF_INET is the
   only supported address family.

address_len 
   Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure pointed to by the address
   argument. (Input)

code
   Upon successful completion, bind() shall return 0; otherwise, −1 shall be
   returned and errno set to indicate the error.
